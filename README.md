DNA Sequencer in Java
=====================

Description
-----------

The DNA Sequencer is a Java-based tool developed for a university project. It efficiently processes and concatenates DNA strands provided as input. The program ensures validation of DNA characters and merges strands based on common characters.

Features
--------

*   Validates input DNA strands for correct nucleotides: 'c', 't', 'g', 'a'.
*   Identifies and selects the first valid strand as the base.
*   Merges additional strands with the base at specific positions.
*   Outputs the concatenated DNA sequence.

How to Compile and Run
----------------------

*   **Compile:** `javac DNASequencer.java`
*   **Execute:** `java DNASequencer Strand1 Strand2`
    *   Replace `Strand1` and `Strand2` with your DNA strands.

Input-Output Test
-----------------

*   Includes an input-output test for verification of functionality.
